# Frontend vs. Backend

## Frontend

- What a user sees and interacts with. This includes things like images, banners, text, links, buttons, navidation menus, etc.
- This is also refered to as the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Document object model (DOM):** according to MDN web docs, the DOM "is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web."

### Document Object Model

- A programming interface for web documents.
- Represents the page so that programs can chance the document structure, style, and content.
- The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects.
- As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language like JavaScript.
- The DOM is built using multiple APIs that work together.
- The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural representation of the document available from a single, consistent API.
