# Frontend vs. Backend

The frontend and backend are two critial parts of any application.

- Frontend includes what users can see and interact with, such as links, images, text, etc. This is what allows them to interact with an application.
- Backend is comprised of the data and infrastructure that make the application work. It is where the application stores and processes data for end users.

## Frontend

- What a user sees and interacts with. This includes things like images, banners, text, links, buttons, navidation menus, etc.
- This is also refered to as the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Document object model (DOM):** according to MDN web docs, the DOM "is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web."
- Frontend languages include **HTML** (page structure), **CSS** (styling), and **JavaScript** (dynamic functionality; DOM manipulation).

### Document Object Model

- A programming interface for web documents.
- Represents the page so that programs can chance the document structure, style, and content.
- The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects.
- As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language like JavaScript.
- The DOM is built using multiple APIs that work together.
- The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural representation of the document available from a single, consistent API.
- The `document` and `window` objects are the object interfaces you'll generally use the most often in DOM programming.
- `window` object represents something like the browser.
- `document` object is the root of the document itself.
- `element` inherits from the generic `Node` interface, and together they provide many of the methods and properties you use on individual elements.
